        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Over the course of my life, I want to try to work on my mental health and have a more positive outlook. If I make a goal, I want to be able to stick with it, or if it does not go my way, adapt to it and not dwell on what went wrong. Additionally, I aspire to grow closer to God and read my Bible more frequently. I believe that this relationship will significantly impact other areas of my life and shape who I am and who I want to be, as well as how I treat those around me. On a social aspect, I want to go out and more, but not just for the sake of going out, but to find and create great connections through hobbies I enjoy. I also want to explore new hobbies. On an emotional level, I am striving to be able to think clearly when experiencing strong emotions. I want to let myself experience emotions and know that they are normal to have and express. At the same time, I want to learn to express them appropriately in the right situations. Lastly, I want to work out more and improve my physical health. By pursuing all of these objectives, I am confident that I will create a fulfilling life filled with wonderful memories alongside my friends and family.</p>
